%description
OliveTin is a web interface for running Linux shell commands. 
  
Use cases
- Give controlled access to run shell commands to less technical folks who cannot be trusted with SSH. I use this so my family can podman restart plex without asking me, and without giving them shell access!
- Great for home automation tablets stuck on walls around your house - I use this to turn Hue lights on and off for example.
- Sometimes SSH access isnâ€™t possible to a server, or you are feeling too lazy to type a long command you run regularly! I use this to send Wake on Lan commands to servers around my house.
